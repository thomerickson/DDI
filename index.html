        <img class="float-right pl-5 pb-5" width="500px" src="./img/SmallDogs1.jpg">
        <strong>Drop Off (starting at 6:30am)</strong>
        <br />
        After a friendly greeting from the front desk attendant, the daycare team chooses which pack of dogs would be
        the best fit for me today, keeping in mind any quirks I have and who my friends are!
        <br /><br />
        <strong>During the day</strong>
        <br />
        I run around and play with friends, grab a few head scratches from my favorite DDI humans, and maybe take a nap
        in the sun during the afternoon. On a warm day the staff will fill up the swimming pools for me. On a chilly day
        they will make sure I have a warm jacket and give me access to the indoors so I can stay comfortable while I
        play.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Pick Up (last pick-up at 6:30pm)</strong>
        <br />
        The front desk attendant retrieves me from the daycare yard and returns me to my parents. They always tell them
        how my day was and who I played with! After a long day of daycare, I’m ready for a quiet night at
        home!<br /><br />

        Dogs love to stay at Dogs Dig It! Our open play boarding lets dogs play and socialize with friends during the
        day and retire to their own personal space in the evenings. We have nearly 14000 square feet for your dog to
        play, socialize and kick back with new friends. Schedule a basic bath or a full service groom during your dogs
        stay. You can even request a series of walks for your dog! Just ask us how we can make your dogs stay with us as
        comfortable and fun as possible.<br /><br />

        If you are new to Dogs Dig It, the first step is to call to schedule a temperament evaluation with you and your
        dog. During this time we make sure your dog will enjoy their time with us meeting new friends in our large
        outdoor play yards. <br /><br />
